## Cookiecutter Data Science Projects 

A project framework based on the [Cookiecutter data science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/pawan-nandakishore/ds_projects_framework



### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this: 

```
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.

│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
│
├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
│   └── figures        <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── src                <- Source code for use in this project.
    ├── __init__.py    <- Makes src a Python module
    │
    ├── data           <- Scripts to download or generate data
    │   └── make_dataset.py
    │
    ├── features       <- Scripts to turn raw data into features for modeling
    │   └── build_features.py
    │
    ├── models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make
    │   │                 predictions
    │   ├── predict_model.py
    │   └── train_model.py
    │
    └── visualization  <- Scripts to create exploratory and results oriented visualizations
        └── visualize.py


```

### Installing development requirements
------------

    pip install -r requirements.txt
